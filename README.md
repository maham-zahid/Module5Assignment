# D'SIGNfly Theme

A sleek, modern WordPress theme designed to provide a responsive, user-friendly experience, featuring custom templates, flexible widget areas, and a powerful theme options panel for easy customization.

## Motivation

During my tenure as a software development intern, I was tasked with developing a custom WordPress theme to deepen my understanding of theme development and contribute to a live project. This project allowed me to explore WordPress’s theme architecture, refine my skills in PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deliver a practical, aesthetically pleasing theme for a real-world application. The objective was to design a user-centric, responsive theme that enhances the user experience and provides a strong foundation for future customization.

## Code Style

This theme adheres to standard WordPress coding practices to ensure clarity, maintainability, and compatibility with other WordPress components. Key code style aspects include:

- **PHP Coding Standards:** All PHP code follows the WordPress PHP Coding Standards, including proper indentation, naming conventions, and thorough documentation.
- **HTML & CSS:** HTML structure complies with semantic HTML5 standards, and CSS is organized modularly, using BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology where applicable.
- **JavaScript:** JavaScript is developed in line with WordPress JavaScript Coding Standards, utilizing jQuery for DOM manipulation while avoiding conflicts with other plugins.
- **Security Best Practices:** The code is written with a strong focus on security, including proper data sanitization, validation, and escaping to prevent vulnerabilities like XSS.
- **Version Control:** Managed under Git version control with clear commit messages and structured branching for a streamlined development process.
